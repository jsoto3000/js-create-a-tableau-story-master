# (FDAND) Create a Tableau Story
---
## Project Overview

For this project, I created a data visualization using Tableau that tells a story and highlights trends and patterns in a data set. The work is a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.


## What I needed to install?

Before working on the project, I needed to have either Tableau Public or Tableau Desktop installed.


## Why this Project?

This project touched on the overarching attitudes and beliefs important to effective data visualization, such as:

(1) Visualization is a dialog
(2) Showcasing and sharing visualizations with others
(3) Visualization is a fluid process that typically requires multiple iterations of improvements

I also had the opportunity to experience the end-to-end process of creating effective data visualizations and highlighting important information from data that may otherwise be hidden or hard to uncover.
